Creating a recipe webpage through the odin project

Will start the foundation of the site with an index.html file
and style it later using CSS. Have been practicing making web
pages on my own, but will hopefully solidify and better my skills
using HTML. Hoping to learn the correct procedure using git
and github as well. Here we go!

Had fun building the website, mastering git and a little of github.
Will use ordered and unordered list more often to make a better structure
of a website in the future. Couple of unnecessary mistakes made to links
that took down efficiency a bit. But the basics are getting a lot better and
I am eager to start styling and adding more to the website.
