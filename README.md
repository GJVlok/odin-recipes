Creating a recipe webpage through the odin project

Will start the foundation of the site with an index.html file
and style it later using CSS. Have been practicing making web
pages on my own, but will hopefully solidify and better my skills
using HTML. Hoping to learn the correct procedure using git
and github as well. Here we go!
