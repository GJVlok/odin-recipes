  <h3 class="description-header">What is Baklava?</h3>
  <p class="description">Baklava is a traditional pastry known for its sweet, 
    rich flavor and flaky texture. It consists of phyllo (or filo) dough, nuts, 
    spices, and a sugary syrup.</p>
  <h4 class="h4-titles">Baklava pronunciation</h4>
  <p>Pronounce "baklava" like "bah-klah-vah." The stress is placed on the 
    first syllable.</p>
  <h4 class="h4-titles">Where is Baklava from?</h4>
  <p class="para">Though baklava is often associated with Greek restaurants now, its exact 
    origins are unclear.

    Food historians think modern baklava may have been invented in Turkey during 
    the Ottoman Empire, then modified in Greece. However, the technique of layering 
    unleavened bread with nuts and honey can be traced back as far as the 8th 
    century B.C.E. during the Assyrian Empire.</p>
  <h3 class="h3-titles">Baklava Ingredients</h3>
  <p class="para">Here's what you need to make the best baklava of your life:</p>
  <h4 class="h4-titles">Phyllo Dough<h4>
    <p class="para">
      Make your own <a>phyllo pastry dough</a> or buy frozen phyllo dough at 
      the store.
    </p>
  <h4 class="h4-titles">Nuts</h4>
    <p class="para">
      Chopped walnuts, pistachios, or a mixture of both are traditionally used. 
      Hazelnuts and/or pecans would also work.
    </p>
  <h4 class="h4-titles">Butter</h4>
    <p class="para">
      Not only does butter add richness and flavor, it keeps the phyllo sheets 
      moist and soft. It also helps the sheets stay together.
    </p>
  <h4 class="h4-titles">Cinnamon</h4>
    <p class="para">
      Cinnamon is responsible for baklava's signature warmth.
    </p>
  <h4 class="h4-titles">Water, Sugar, Vanilla, and Honey</h4>
    <p class="para">
      A sweet syrup — made from water, sugar, vanilla extract, and honey — is 
      poured over the baked baklava layers, bringing the delicious dessert 
      together.
    </p>
  <h3 class="h3-titles">How to Make Baklava</h3>
  <img src="../images/greek-baklava-s-tuttle.png" width="400px">
  <p class="para">Even though making baklava can be a bit time-consuming, 
    it's probably not as hard as you think. You'll find the full recipe below, 
    but here's a brief overview of what you can expect.</p>
  <h3 class="h3-titles">Layer Phyllo with Nuts</h3>
  <p class="para">Stack eight sheets of phyllo dough, brushing with butter between each layer, 
    to create a sturdy base. Sprinkle it with a mixture of chopped nuts and cinnamon.
     Top with two sheets of phyllo dough and follow with the nut mixture. Repeat this 
     process a few more times, until the nut mixture is gone. Top with about eight 
     more layers of phyllo, buttering each layer.</p>
  <h3 class="h3-titles">Cut and Bake</h3>
  <p class="para">Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes. Be sure to cut all the way 
    to the bottom of the pan. Bake until golden and crisp.</p>
  <h3 class="h3-titles">Finish with Syrup</h3>
  <p class="para">Boil water and sugar until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. 
    Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour syrup over it. Let cool 
    before serving.</p>
  <h3 class="h3-titles">How to Store Baklava</h3>
  <p class="para">Baklava is super sugary, so it has a relatively long shelf-life. 
    It will last for about two weeks stored in an airtight container. Keep 
    it in the pantry if you like your baklava crispy. If you like it chewy, 
    opt for the fridge.</p>
  <h3 class="h3-titles">Can You Freeze Baklava?</h3>
  <p class="para">Yes, you can definitely freeze baklava. Just let it cool completely, 
    wrap it in a layer of storage wrap, and then a layer of aluminum foil. 
    Follow with another layer of aluminum foil for added protection. Freeze for 
    up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight.</p>
