  <p class="description">Baklava is a delicious Greek dessert made up of layers of crispy phyllo dough, 
    honey and nuts that's so easy to make. A Greek friend showed me how to make 
    this fabulous recipe.</p>
  <h3 class="ingredients-header">Ingredients</h3>
  <ul class="ingredients-list">
    <li>Phyllo Dough</li>
    <li>Nuts</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Cinnamon</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Vanilla</li>
    <li>Honey</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="steps-header">Steps</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li>Layer Phyllo with Nuts</li>
      <p>Stack eight sheets of phyllo dough, brushing with butter between each 
        layer, to create a sturdy base. Sprinkle it with a mixture of chopped nuts 
        and cinnamon. Top with two sheets of phyllo dough and follow with the nut 
        mixture. Repeat this process a few more times, until the nut mixture 
        is gone. Top with about eight more layers of phyllo, buttering each layer.</p>
    <li>Cut and Bake</li>
      <p>Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes. Be sure to cut all 
        the way to the bottom of the pan. Bake until golden and crisp.</p>
    <li>Finish With Syrup</li>
      <p>Boil water and sugar until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. 
        Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour syrup over it. 
        Let cool before serving.</p>
